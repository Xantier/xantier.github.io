Something I've been playing with in my head quite a bit has been the transition of moving from old Java + Spring MVC + JSP/Thymeleaf/whatever style web sites to modern progressively enhanced web apps using more modern technologies. I want to touch few of the points that I've found useful during my journey doing that.

Old Architecture style
We all know this and will inherit a bunch of codebases that will be built this way. Big thanks to anyone who has every written tutorials and templates to do this, there must be tons of them online since a lot of Spring stack using folks seem to follow the same pattern. So how does a Spring MVC Web "App" look in my mind? 
Let's take a look:

Backend Architecture:


Frontend Architecture:


If you are finding bunch of similarities on your codebase and the architecture described above, you might be interested in the series of posts I intend to write on it and how we make a transformation from it to a modern web app. Yes, that means that you might have to take a look at some of the technologies and techniques that "those hipsters" in Silicon Valley are using. 

The end result that will come out of this process is still a little bit hazy and unclear even to me since the world is moving at a fast pace in the world of web development. Regardless of that, let's hope we are able to find a way to make developers, users, our servers and even product owners happier during the process. 

Lot's of words, not actual info, so take a look at this nice little drawing. Maybe something like this could work?

Future architecture:

(Note, this might or might not be the final solution. I think we will find out eventually).
