## Dublin Kotliners kickoff meeting

On the American independence day I had the opportunity to host our first meetup around Kotlin language in Dublin, Ireland. What better way to celebrate American independence day than talk about Russian built programming language. 

Below is an iFrame [the slides from my introductory presentation to the language](http://jussi.hallila.com/kotlin_for_java_devs/). The code examples from these slides can be found from [the Github repo](https://github.com/Xantier/kotlin_for_java_devs).
