I am a full-stack web developer with vast experience on Spring framework and modern frontend web application development. In my previous positions I have modernized frontend development codebases and architecture decisions to conform industry best practices. I have been the lead contributor to core products on both backend and frontend side of applications. I am an expert on transforming older legacy Java based web applications to more modern Javascript based web development standards, including build processes, testing and frontend application architecture. I also have lots of experience on bringing in automation and smarter way of working. I have introduced and coached DevOps & ChatOps (including chatbots) practices as well as development processes, including more formalized code quality measures and more effective strategies around development and delivery.

For my hobbies I like to keep up with latest trends in technology. Most of my free time is spent developing various Node.js, Kotlin and React applications for my own entertainment. I prefer developing in an agile environment where communication between team members and customers is fluent and honest. I have a passion to learning and following industry best practices. I have a strong drive for innovation and making things easier as well as automation and doing things a smarter way.
