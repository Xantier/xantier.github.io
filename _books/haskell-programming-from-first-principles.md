Chris Allen is *the* person to go to when one wants to learn more about Haskell. This book starts from the basics and increases difficulty in a well structured, easily followable manner. Since the book really goes through things from First Principles, it also introduces a lot of ways to *unlearn* things. A quality that is definitely needed when one wants to venture into Haskell from C-based languages. Easily the best book on Haskell.
