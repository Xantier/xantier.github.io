While spiraling down into functional programming more and more I, like many others, stumbled upon categroy theory. Looking for a good explanation *what does it actually mean* has been tough but so far the closest I have gotten to understand is due to Bartosz Milewski and his book and videos. Excellent quality, explains things very well. The topic is very difficult but Milewski is able to shed some light into the mathematical world and theories behind functional programming patterns.
