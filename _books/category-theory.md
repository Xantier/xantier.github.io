While spiraling down into functional programming more and more I, like many others, stumbled upon categroy theory. Looking for a good explanation *what does it actually mean* has been tough but so far the closest I have gotten to understand is due to Bartosz Milewski and his book and videos. Excellent quality so far and explains things very well. Still some work to do on this category, both for me as well as the book. No rating since book is still unfinished.
