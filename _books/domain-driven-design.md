A classic book on designing your domain entities within your application. A good book to read through especially at this day and age of increased drive towards modularity and componentization. Book itself contains a good amount of nice examples and use cases from real life, both successful and some missteps. For me this started a bit slowly but especially the penultimate chapter around bounded context gave some nice hints to mold thought processes. The book is a good companion for people who spend lot of time of their days huddled around white boards trying to come up with perfect designs.
