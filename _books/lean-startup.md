The book most people recommend when looking for a path to the entrepeneurial life. Lean Startup is a good starting point to read on that journey. It outlines most of the important aspects and techniques that can be used. Most of the things I got out of this book was a some kind of mindset shift towards more iterative style of developing myself and products I work on. It is a really good read and I would recommend it to everyone interested in the subject . Somehow I have a feeling that it could have been much better or that there are better books around the topic out there.
