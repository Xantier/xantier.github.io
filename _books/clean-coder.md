Continuation to Uncle Bob's Clean Code, this time touching the career aspect of software engineering. Goes through the needed behaviours in a workplace. Explains about why professionalism is important and outlines the steps how to achieve that. The book contains more or less everything a developer needs to thrive in a workplace when one is not on his IDE going through the codebase (though that part is mentioned as well). Another book I can wholeheartedly recommend.
