My first touch to Haskell. This book was a breath of fresh air in the category of books teaching programming languages. Very funnily written as well as educational. The whole concept around the topic was brilliantly executed and taught me a massive amount of new knowledge on a difficult topic. As an originally imperative style student some parts were difficult to grasp but that is not the books' fault. Could've used a little bit of exercises but in general a brilliant introduction to Haskell.
