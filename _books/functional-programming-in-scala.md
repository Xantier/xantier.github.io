The red Scala book. Very challenging but also so rewarding. The book will teach you functional programming if you go through the exercises. For me this title was able to tilt my head in a way that I understood the core concepts of functional style in Scala. The exercises in the book are a must do if you want to keep up with the content. If the exercises are done, it is guaranteed that you will finish this book as a better developer. For people already writing nearly fuctional code and wanting to take themselves to the next level -> get this book, this will definitely take you there.
