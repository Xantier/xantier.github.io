Brialliant little Gitbook about functional programming in Javascript. Dr. Boolean's way of writing makes to whole thing a huge pleasure to read and exercises at the end of each chapter match very well the topic at hand. This book gave me a much greater insight on binding and chaining, as well as how to handle wrappedd objects in a functional way. Also the content on composing was excellently written and that alone makes the book worth opening up. Very good, hopefully the author has time to continue the series with more chapters.
