A classic book recommended by many, if not most, software developers. Explains every aspect about code starting from basic variable namings to complex build and testing systems. Unfortunately for me the book came a little bit too late on my career so I was mostly nodding along when reading through the pages on this book. The content is brilliant, though at times a little bit in need of an update. This is one of those books that you would really want to buy for the intern or just graduated coworker, they will learn loads from this one.
