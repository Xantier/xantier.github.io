At time cynical, depressing and definitely thought provoking book. Paints a beautiful picture of the future of our industry from a developers point of view. The suddenly outlines the software industry, career paths and progressions and the cut-throat world of corporate developers life, before eventually settling into actual advice how to get good, how to advance ones career and how to find happiness as a software developer. Definitely recommendable.
