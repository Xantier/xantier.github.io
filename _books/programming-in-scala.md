Heavy and thick book on Scala. The book covers everything around the core Scala language and explains in detail core concepts around both object oriented and functional parts of Scala. What I found most interesting in this were the insights on why a language feature was implemented in such a way and what the thought process was behind such and such approach. The book really does an in depth analysis why the design decisions were made that way and also what approaches one would take when using Scala. The book is brilliant and will teach everyone reading it a lot, about Scala and about programming in general.
