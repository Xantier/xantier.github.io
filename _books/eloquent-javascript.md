An excellent introductory book to the language of Javascript. When peope ask for recommendations of a Javascript book this is the one I usually recommend if I feel that the reader is starting out with programming. Starts with the basics and builds on top of that. I probably wouldn't recommend this as a first JS book if you know programming already but for a somewhat novice developer this is one of the best you can get.
