Legendary Design Patterns by the Gang of Four. The nature of the book makes it somewhat hard to read since in the end it is a catalogue of patterns that you can utilize in your object oriented code. Don't get me wrong, I have opened the pages on this book probably more times than any other one in my bookshelf but that has been mostly to check the list of patterns from the first page and then continue search the implementation of that pattern from the internet. Somewhat labourious read due to the structure but is one of the classics so needs to sit in the bookshelf of every proud developer.
