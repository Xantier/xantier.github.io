This book is probably one of my all time favourites. The information within these covers is invaluable to all developers. The book explains why code quality is important and the notion of software craftsmanship, being proud of your creations and the ideas of *code smells*. Even though the book was written using Java in code examples the meaning of it goes well beyond that. All the essential structures of *good looking* code that is easy pleasant to work with is touched in the book. This one is probably the one I would recommend the most to developers jumping into the industry and I definitely have hoped many times that my coworkers would own a copy of this. Classic.
