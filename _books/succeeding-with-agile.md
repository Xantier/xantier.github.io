One book about Scrum I really enjoyed. Even though I think Scrum has seen it's glory days and will decline in the future to yet another management fad I found good information about it from this book. Mike Cohn is one of the founding fathers of Scrum and knows what he is talking about. If you want to direct your career towards scrum mastery and management side, this title is a really good starting point. It lays out everything you need to know about Scrum, starting from basics and expanding all the way to distributed and massive teams.
