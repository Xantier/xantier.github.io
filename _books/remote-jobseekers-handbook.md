Nice small book about resources and techniques on how to find and survive remote work. Chapters around remote work itself and what kind of expectations one should impose on it are very interesting and contain a lot of useful information. I would have liked those to be a little bit longer and contain more insightful tips and experiences on that. The content regarding online resources etc. is useful but might work better in an online form. In the end the book is a good introduction to remote work and lines out things one should expect about it.
