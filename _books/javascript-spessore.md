The other caffeinated Javascript book. This is very tightly coupled with Javascript Allonge and works very well as a yang to allonge's yin. Spessore is more about objects and how those are, or should be handled in Javascript and how we can utilize them fully when writing in this language. Excellent book, though a tiny bit behind Javascript Allonge.
