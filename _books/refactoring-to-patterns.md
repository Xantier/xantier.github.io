A glue book between Gang of Four's design patterns and Marting Fowler's Refactoring. The book is a catalogued collection of code smells and steps how to get to the needed design patternized solution out of that smell. Unfortunately much of the book is geared towards legacy code and at times somewhat outdated. Also much of the solutions tend to be fairly simple and straightforward. It is a good complement to Refactoring but in itself I don't think it will give much insights to competent Java developers.
