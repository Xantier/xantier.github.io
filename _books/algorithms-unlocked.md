Good introductory book to algorithms if that is you cup of tea. Tries it's best to be approachable and easy to understand and does a decent job on it. Goes through sorting, Acyclic Graphs, Shortest Paths and Cryptography. Apart from exercises trying to found exploitable arbitrage in Bitcoin exchanges (Bellman-Ford) I haven't found much use on the techniques from this book.
