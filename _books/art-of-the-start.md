A classic book on startup circles about entrepreneurism and building your own business. Did not hit a home run with me and the tactics recommended in the book were at times a bit out of my reach. Could be that the timing wasn't correct for me to read this title but in the end I did not get much out of it. I still believe this is a recommendable book to people in the process of spinning up a business.
