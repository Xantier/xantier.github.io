Short-ish introduction to Reactive programming and operators that can be used when building reactive pipelines. Goes through the basic concepts fairly well and touches a good amount of different approaches one might want to take when working with observables. Could use a little bit more of mindshift type of topics explaining in more detail the reasoning behind the whole reactive streams movement and when one should jump on that and when not. All in all this book is a good introduction to RX and worth checking out.
