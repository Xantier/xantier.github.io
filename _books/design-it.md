Design it was a somewhat interesting book to read. It outlines the aspects what makes one a software architect and how we in essence have software architects in teams already, regardless of the title itself. The most interesting part of this book for me was its focus on communication patterns between architects and various stakeholders; other devs, clients and the system itself. The book closes out with a catalogue of exercises that can be arranged within a company to improve this communication and information sharing. The technical bits in the book are somewhat slim, which is understandable considering that it rather creates an overview of the role of an architect rather than the end result of software architecture.
