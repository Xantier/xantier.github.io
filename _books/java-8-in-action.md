A good listing of new features in Java 8. Explains thoroughly the new streams API and usage of Lambdas around your codebase. Touches Optional and how that can be used and talks a little bit about async programming with Java 8. I enjoyed the chapters of how to shift into functional style thinking in Java 8, though so much more could be said on that. This is probably a good introductory book on the new features of Java 8 for people not so familiar with functional programming concepts. It doesn't go too deep into the paradigm but touches it on the surface which is a good compromise for this kind of book. In the end the book is a good fit for developers jumping to the next JDK from previous versions.
