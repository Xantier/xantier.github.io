A book containing patterns and tidbits how to write good or *brillian* Java code. Goes through the essential parts of the language and explains why and how it can be used effectively. While working with Java I usually end up going through writings of the author quite a bit since his collections library in the JDK is probably the most elegant piece of code within every project I lay my hands on. Every person writing Java should read this book.
