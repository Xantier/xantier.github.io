A good book about test-drive development. It goes through techniques in detail how to improve the quality of your code base with testing. For me this title came at a good time since I was just making a bigger shift towards embracing more TDD. The book laid out a good groundwork on the type of coding around that area. Sometimes the content is a little bit too basic but all in all the book is a good read if the timing is correct. You need to know your testing a little, but not too much for this to hit home.
