Scala has an "programming IQ" requirement on par or greater than Lisp. Probably not as high as Haskell's however, or stuff like APL and Forth.
Kotlin seems to be targetting the "programming IQ" of Java circa JDK7 but with improvements.
IMO the Streams, Closures, and a lot of the Optional bolt-on stuff in JDK8+ has raised it's necessary IQ quite a lot, especially since closures still have a lot more limitations and the occasional "class must be final" problems, and the stream magic isn't entirely transparent.
So while Scala may not be sinking, it doesn't really have the potential for mainstream development. Kotlin does...
