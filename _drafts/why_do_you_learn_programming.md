There are more and more people in the world currently studying programming or thinking of programming. There are also more and more opportunities to all levels of programmers around the world. There are initiatives to teach children programming from a younger age and light up the spark to the profession more and more. Yet there is still a lack of skill in the industry. Why is that?



Programming is art. Why do you want to learn it?

I come from a musical family. My mind is engineering one but artistic juice flows through my veins very strongly. I believe that is the biggest individual contributor to my passion towards my profession as a developer and my insatiable thirst to learn more about it. Naturally professional artists, musicians, poets are as well very passionate about their craft. I tend to think that math-physical fields are the ones that drive the most amount of passionate people towards the profession. Maybe there is a some kind of connection here.

If we look at programming in general it is an artform. As a developer you craft something from nothing. It doesn't matter if your development process goes is large design upfront or iterative, trialing style. In both cases you take artistic freedom and craft your output very uniquely. The fingerprint of an individual developer is clearly visible from their code.

The code is also similarly critically reviewed as art is.
