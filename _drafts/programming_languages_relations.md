All the JVM languages tend to be on the same page and their communities naturally interop pretty well with each other. If we draw an analogy to a family a bit further we can see that Java plays the role a father/mother in the room. This comes in two varieties where Oracle/OpenJDK is the initial bread earner and Android Java has come into the relationship a little later. Android JDK also is going through some tough times and testing the waters on its own or with its new friend.

Children for this couple are of course the other JVM languages.
We can think of Android JDK as the stepmother/stepfather to many of these. That is due to it growing apart and it's community being somewhat isolated in the landscape of JVM langs.
In this family we have few children:

Groovy being the liberal and somewhat hip one of the family. In high school being the cool kid but often times struggling to find its true calling in the adult life. It is usually doing short gigs here and there, mosty building and construction work, to earn some money and figure out what it really wants to do with it's life.

Scala is the one who spent its early years gathering a lot of information. It got into an ivy league school and learned a lot of very technical things. After school it has tried its feet in a lot of places. Many of these workplaces have found Scala very efficient and smart worker. Often times though Scala has gotten its job through its parents network and, mayhaps due to generation gap, these workplaces have not always worked for well for Scala. All in all it has grown up to a responsible adult and done well for himself though 30s crisis has taken some steam out of the brilliant engine. During its university years Scala gained a lot of friends in the functional programming family.

Frege is still a baby. It was born when Scala introduced one of its university friends to the JVM family. The father of this child is unknown but the friend that was introduced to JVM was Haskell. Frege is still stumbling it's first steps in JVM house and therefore has a lot to learn from his aunts and uncles.

JRuby decided early in its life what it wants to do with itself. It decided to study abroad for his specialized degree and made a lot friends around artistic web development circles.

Clojure was adopted by the JVM family while he was running away from his neglegted family. Its old family used to live on the same block so Clojure decided to knock on the door. It fell in love with the vast house and backyard JVM family had and decided to stay and play in the house. Eventually the family looked past the peculiar shape and color of Clojure and decided to adopt Clojure to the family.
