How? 
What works? 
How long does it take? 

We as developers at times take our work very seriously. This can be seen on literature directed towards devs, like Uncle Bob's 60-hour-weeks (40 hours for the company you are working for, 20 hours for your self to sharpen your tools). It is also very much present in the industry dogma, culture and hiring processes. There are multiple articles highlighting that you cannot be good if you don't have a strong Github profile or if you don't follow industry hype as you go a long. This much commitment to an occupation might seem weird from the outside perspective and it is not without reason. 

Of course all of this passion toward something that is occupying already so much about our daily comes also with down sides. Classic jokes about programming highlight the long sleepless nights where our brain finally figures out how to fix that bug or get over that bump a developer has encoutered in his routine. Developers bury their heads in their hands in frustration because they are not able to make a feature work. 

When things go wrong in the code base, it can take a big toll mentally to developers as well.
