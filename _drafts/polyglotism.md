Why would you want to go polyglot?

During my life I've lived in five different language areas. On two of these I have been able to communicate with the natives very easily because we have been able to speak the same language. On the other three not so much. My resistance to learn a local language properly to communicate, or even try to communicate is one the big regrets in my life. Learning languages always gives you a different perspective on the minds of the local people. Nelson Mandela famously said that "The way to someones heart is to speak to them in their own language."

I like to extend that thought process to programming languages as well. Learning new languages is one of my hobbies, playing around with side projects in a new language is always exciting and it always gives me so much insight that the price of slower initial velocity is well worth it.

The syntax doesn't matter because over time you get used to it. This step of the transition comes easier the more languages you learn or try out.

Every time I touch a new language I have to immerse into the ecosystem and community. This is a very important step in the learning process. Like with human languages the culture of the community differs and that drives the ecosystem as well.

The more languages you know the more starting points you have to start solving your problem.

During these times where tensions due to cultural differences are on the rise again familiarity with ones language makes a big difference. This same matters for programming languages as well. Interoperability between teams, ecosystems and communities depend a lot on the programming language we are talking about.
