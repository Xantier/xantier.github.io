# Hi there!

I'm Jussi Hallila, a Finnish software engineer from Dublin, Ireland. You've stumbled upon my journal on all things coding. I usually write some notes for myself that I believe would be good to organize in a better way. This is mostly for my own entertainment and helping me to find the correct path to explain these concepts in my day job.

I consider myself a true full stack developer. By that I mean that my skills range from deep black infrastructure to most hipster frontend technologies and anything in between. If you find something that interests you, give me a shout and I am more than happy to talk more about it.
