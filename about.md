# Hi there!

I'm Jussi Hallila, a Finnish software engineer from Dublin, Ireland. You've stumbled upon my journal on all things coding. I usually write some notes for myself that I believe would be good to organize in a better way. This is mostly for my own entertainment and helping me to find the correct path to explain these concepts in my day job. If you find something that interests you, give me a shout and I am more than happy to talk more about it.

```Talk is cheap, show me the code.```
